### Development

Before proceeding, make sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) 
and [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed on your system.

Start a shell and install server-side dependencies:

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

Install client-side dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Spawn the server and client concurrently:

```bash
bunx concurrently \
  --kill-others \
  --names 'server,client' \
  --prefix-colors 'green.bold,magenta.bold' \
  --prefix '[{name}] ' \
  --prefix-length 2 \
  --success first \
  --handle-input \
  --timestamp-format 'HH:mm:ss' \
  --color \
  -- \
  'python3 app.py' \
  'bun run dev'
```
